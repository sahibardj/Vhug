                    Women need effective, safe, and affordable menstrual products. The menstrual cup is a lesser-known but highly effective alternative. The design is a compact, 
                    flexible funnel-shaped cup made of rubber or silicone that you insert into your vagina to collect period fluid. 
                </p>    
                   <p>
                    The effectiveness of it is highly praised and trusted; many women swear by it. A menstrual cup may hold blood for about 5-12hours depending on the flow and size of the cup you are using. Instead of absorption like a tampon or pad, it catches and collects your fluids. They usually are in the shape of a bell and a stem. Bell creates a vacuum, and the stem is useful for providing grip during removal. 
                   </p>


                   <h3>Instructions: </h3>
                   <h3>Before Insertion (optional)</h3>
                                   <p>
                               While using a menstrual cup for the first time, you may feel uncomfortable. Lubricating your cup can help in making the process smooth. Before insertion of the cup, lubricate the rim with water or water-based lube. 
                   </p>

How to put in your menstrual cup? 
</h3>
<p>
There are several folds for insertion. 
</p>
<p>
<i class="material-icons">arrow_forward</i> C-Fold -Take your Cup, fold it in half so that the lips touch together, then slowly bend the cup in half again lengthwise. You will see that the point of insertion looks like a C 
</p>
            <p>
                <i class="material-icons">arrow_forward</i>Punch Down Fold- Hold your menstrual cup. Use your thumb to push the lip of the cup down towards the base of the cup. Then remove your thumb as you squeeze the edges together. 
            </p>
            
            
            <p>
                <i class="material-icons">arrow_forward</i>7 Fold- Fold your menstrual cup in half so that the lips touch. Now pull down the right side, form a '7' shape with the cup's lips. To make the Triangle version, bring the right corner right down towards the cup's base to create a triangular shape. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <i class="material-icons">arrow_forward</i>E Fold- Take your menstrual cup and pinch down the right side so that the lips of the cup touch together. Then press the left side towards the right, to form a T shape. Bring the sides of the T shape down around the pinched right side to create an E shape. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <i class="material-icons">arrow_forward</i>
                S Fold -Holding your menstrual cup, push the lips of the cup together. Slowly push one side up and the other side down while pressing together to form an S shape. 
            </p>
            
     

<h3>
    Steps for insertion: 
</h3>
<p>
    Wash your hands thoroughly. 

    <br><i class="material-icons"> arrow_forward</i>Apply water or water-based lube to the rim of the cup. 

   <br>     <i class="material-icons">arrow_forward</i>Make the desired fold. 

<br> <i class="material-icons">arrow_forward</i>Insert the cup, rim up, into your vagina like you would a tampon without an applicator. It should sit a few inches below your cervix. 

<br>
<i class="material-icons">arrow_forward</i>Once the cup is in your vagina, rotate it. It will spring open to create an airtight seal that stops leaks. 
</p>
<p>
<br>
<b>When and how to remove? 
<br>
It is safe to wear up to 12 hours but to avoid leakage, it is recommended to empty it every 5-6 hours. </b>

<p>
    <i class="material-icons">arrow_forward</i>Wash your hands thoroughly.  </p>
    <i class="material-icons">arrow_forward</i> Place your index finger and thumb into your vagina. Pull the stem of the cup gently until you can reach the base. </p>
    <i class="material-icons">arrow_forward</i>Pinch the bottom to release the seal and pull down to remove the cup.  </p>

    <i class="material-icons">arrow_forward</i>Once it's out, empty the cup into the sink or toilet.  </p>

<h3>
    Cup aftercare 
</h3>            
<p>
    The cup should be washed with plain water, non-scented soap/wash or wipe out clean with toilet paper depending on the availability before reinsertion. After the end of each cycle or at the start of a new cycle, the cup should be boiled in hot water for 10 mins, making sure the cup doesn't contact the utensil. The cup should be kept inside a cotton pouch in a dry environment.

            It's sometimes difficult to find the right fit- Cups come in different sizes depending on your age, flow, and whether you’ve had a child. Still, finding the perfect fit can be a challenge, more so if you have a tilted uterus or low cervix.

            </td>
<td class="p">
    It could interfere with an IUD- Some manufacturers don’t recommend using a menstrual cup if you have an intrauterine device (IUD) inserted, as there’s a chance the cup could pull on the string or dislodge it.

                Can contain more - A menstrual cup can hold 1 ounce of liquid, roughly twice the amount of a super-absorbent tampon or pad. The difference can be a comfort on your heavy flow days.

            <td class="p">
                There’s less odor - Menstrual blood can start to smell when it’s exposed to air. But your cup forms an airtight seal.
